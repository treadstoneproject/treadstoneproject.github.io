## Abstract

Computer Virus is one of the major security concerns for many enterprises that heavily used personal computer. Virus scanning software becomes an important tool that allows users to detect computer virus threat early. This work presents the parallelization techniques that enable the malware detected engine, which used Aho-Corasick algorithm, to run on multi-core computer more efficiently. This technique is very useful in enhancing the performance of a computer virus scanning process. The concept can also be applied to various anti-virus software.
